Installation methods are listed here: http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/Prepare_your_SD_card

There is an even simpler method (if you're not using a Mac and card is smaller than 64G):
- format SD card in camera, selection settings -> format
- extract zip to card (all files and directories)
- start cam with the PLAYBACK button, press MENU, locate "Firm update" in the bottom of the menu, execute it
  -> cam will reboot, CHDK will start
- change to normal play mode, then MENU to enter the CHDK menu
- navigate to "Miscellaneous stuff" -> "SD Card" and execute "Make card bootable"
- switch off the cam, take out the card, lock it, put it back in
- CHDK will automatically start from now on
